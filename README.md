# Trend Line Trading Strategy
(*This project is old! You may need to change some of it.*)
Using majors from another project that exist in my projects, it can find the trend lines in the chart and make buy and sell signals...

Install these before use:  
``` bash
	pip instal pandas
	pip install numpy
	pip install matplotlib
	pip install scikit-learn
```
Enjoy :wink:
